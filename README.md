I am Sudarshan Paul, a final year B.Tech. ECE student from Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Coimbatore. My area of interests include Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I have prior experience to work on Data Science and Analytics based projects, one of my major project in this field include dashboard development and "Financial Data Modeling" for a leading MSME firm and developed a Cost-Analysis Tool-Kit Web Application named - "SIMPLICOST". 

I have a good command over Data Visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Cufflinks etc in order to demonstrate data in the form of various graphs and charts for in-depth analysis. 

### "I combine magic and science to create illusions. I work with new media and interactive technologies, things like artificial intelligence or computer vision, and integrate them in my magic." ~ Marco Tempest (Swiss Magician)
So Yes!, this is where my current learning is headed towards! (No! Not aspiring to be a Magician, but yeah! the field of Computer Vision and Image Processing is what keeps me glued these days!)
